            ##### Here I am creating a report to summarizing my research including:
            - Avg charging time taken by customers for full charge in Pune, Mumbai, Nashik and Aurangabad (separate for each city)
            - Are customers charging full (i.e. say from 5% to 100%) or only incremental charging every time (i.e. say from 25% to 80%)
            - What time of the day the charging takes place (are people charging the most during day or nighttime?)
            - Avg daily k.m. run of customers in Pune, Mumbai, Nashik and Aurangabad (separate for each city)
            - Highest k.m. run so far in single charge in Pune, Mumbai, Nashik and Aurangabad (separate for each city)
